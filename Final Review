CIDR - Classless interdomain routing 

CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) -- also known as supernetting -- is a method of assigning Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
that improves the efficiency of address distribution and replaces the previous system based on Class A, Class B and Class C networks.

Subnet is a segment of a VPC that lives entirely within an availability zone

Subnets cannot span more than one AZ
Subnets can be public, private and VPN

Default VPC CIDR block is 172.31.0.0/16

AWS recommends in choosing a private addressing space is shown below;

192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (Offers 1 /16 Range)
172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (Offers 16 /16 Range)
10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (Offers 256 /16 Range)


NACL operates on a subnet level
When creating a subnet the smallest subnet range you can have is /28 netmask and the largest is /16 netmask
AWS reserves the first four IP address and the last IP address of the subnet. So fice address is lawyas reserved


VPC Routing

This is the first place where packets hit while leaving resources that are in a VPC/Subnet
