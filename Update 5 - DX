AWS Direct connect and Hybrid

AWS S2S VPN are only initiated from Onprem to AWS
VPN traffic uses public infrastructure

VPN uses out to internet data transfer billing rates
VGW is limited to a maximum of 1.25 GBPs for all VPN connections

DX connections are always ON on both direction
Traffic uses a dedicated infrastructure 
Reduced rates for data transfer charges
Flat hourly port charges
10 Gbps max per connection
Multiple connections can be created and used simultaneously, maximum combined speed of maximum 40GBPS

Hybrid DNS enables private DNS resolution across connected cloud and on-prem networks

DX - Is a direct connect, High Throughput, Dedicated, Low latency to an AWS region

Accessed by Globally placed DX locations
AWS customer can provide thier own hardware at DX locations or use partner hardware
Customers traffic is isolated by VLANS in AWS

In DX locations, AWS installed its own hardware and connected with the AWS datatcenter with a high throughput link

Hardware configuration requirements :-

Single mode fiber
Either 1000 Base LX (1 GBPS) or 10GBase-LR (10 GBPS) transceivers
Disable auto negotiation on all ports used with BGP
No static routing in DX
802.IQ VLAN encapsulation must be supported across entire connection
Devices must support BGP and BGP md5 authentication
Bi-directional forwarding detection is supported but not required

Customer must estalish connection with DX location using local telco carrier
Customer might be fully or partially responsible for hardware at DX locations

Why do we need virtual interfaces?

We need virtual interfaces because by themselves DX connections are layer 2 circuits
DX connections do not directly support IP traffic
Virtual interface allow IP communication over DX connections


Communications with AWS services is layer 3

DX Virtual interface provide layer 3 connectivity

Private VIFs connect to private AWS networks

Private VIFs can attach to either
A single VGW
A single direct connect gateway which can connect upto 10 different VPCs in different regions

Public Virtual Interface -

Public VIFs connect to AWS Public services

Public VIF allows you to connect all AWS services in all public regions without using internet

Layer 2 networks can be logically divided into virtual LANS

Each VIF must run on its own VLAN

Hosted VIF will connect only a single VLAN

Hosted VIF allows a DX connection owned by one AWS account to be used by a different account
Hosted VIFs are created by the owner of of the DX connection and offered to the other AWS account

Without a direct connect gateway, a VIF will connect only to a single VPC
VLAN ID will be On-prem VLAN (VIF Configuration in AWS)

VIFs have a maximum number of prefixes that can be advertised to AWS

Private VIFs - 100
Public VIFs - 1000

Exeeding this limit will cause the BGP sessions to go to the IDLE state

VGWs assocoated with private VIFs advertise all known routes
VGWs associated with DX gateways must specifiy allowed prefixes to be advertised
All VIFs requried a customer configured BGP peer

LAG (Link Aggregation Group)

A collection of multiple physical links combined into to a single, logical link

All DX connection in a LAG must use the same bandwidth, must terminate at the same DX location

Maximum of 4 connections per LAG
Maximum of 10 LAGS per region

Customer side LAGS must be created to support VIF traffic

Note - Hosted connections cannot bundle into a LAG


What are DC gateways?

Global services that facilitates DX connectivity to multiple AWS regions
A bridge between transit or private VIFs and othe AWS networking objects
No interaction with public VIFs
Are free of charge

By itself, A Private VIF can connect only to a single VGW
DX gateways may connect a single private VIF upto 10 VGWs in any public region

DX gateways are global service

VPCs connecting through a DX gateway cannot have overlapping IP ranges
Only sessions via a single VIF to one connected VPC at a time are allowed

You cannot send traffic - from one associated VPC to another
from one connected VIF to another
from a connected VIF through a VPN connection using an associated VPG

Well Architected DX

Resiliency  

Multiple connections at single DX location
Multiple DX locations
Implement LAGS


AWS does not encrypt DX traffic
VPN tunnels may be established from on-prem to EC2 based VPN systems

AWS site to site via public VIF
