You are reviewing the architecture for a current setup where a VPC endpoint has been created to access S3 data privately within a VPC. The default endpoint policy is in place, and when trying to access the bucket, 
your access is denied. What can be done to solve this issue?

Add the VPC endpoint to the S3 bucket policy.
Add the VPC ID to the S3 bucket policy.

Network Access Control Lists or NACLs are stateless firewall on a subnet. They have an ordered lists of rules where the lowest rule number is 
evaluated first and higher rule numbers are evaluated after. Rules can be defined as allow or deny rules.

As a network engineer, you are in charge of adding and removing rules to a particular security group associated with some of the IPv4 resources your team is managing. 
You are making an API call to add a particular inbound rule and receiving the following error back: RulesPerSecurityGroupLimitExceeded. 
What is the reason and solution for this error?

You have the maximum number of inbound rules for the security group already defined at 60. Create another security 
group with the inbound rule, and attach it to the ENI of the resource you are managing.

Your organization is using a single EC2 instance for a ticketing system and its related traffic. This custom application has been installed on a Linux-based instance. 
Which of the following implementations can help achieve higher bandwidth for the ticketing system and its traffic?

We can enable Enhanced Networking to help achieve high bandwidth.
The other answers mainly deal with multiple EC2 instances when we only have one EC2 for our application.

Security groups are assigned to instances (technically the network adaptor attached to the instance). Security Group rules are allow rules only, 
and are stateful meaning that return traffic is automatically allowed.

Your team is using an EC2 NAT instance for NAT translation in your VPC. The private subnet has a route table with the 0.0.0.0/0 routing to the NAT instance.
Whenever packages are installed onto private instances, the traffic is extremely slow. What can be done to resolve this issue?

To increase the bandwidth first take a look at the instance type of the NAT instance. 
Increasing the size of the underlying EC2 instance running the NAT translation could increase speed. 
Also, migrating the NAT instance to a NAT gateway is a viable options since NAT gateways scale up to 45 Gbps.

You launch an EC2 instance in a private subnet that needs to access the Internet to download and install the packages. 
You decide to launch a NAT gateway in your VPC to provide NAT translation. Where in the VPC should the NAT gateway sit inside?

Whenever we launch a NAT gateway, it must reside in a public subnet to provide NAT translation. Public and private hosted zones are part of Route 53.

You work for a company who has a need to send large amounts of data that will be ingested by S3. The data that is ingested must be 
encrypted in transit and this ingestion process will happen on a regular interval. 
What option, in of itself, can accomplish this?

Use HTTPS (TLS) for in transit encryption.

To ensure that the data is encrypted during the intransit process, we can use HTTPS (TLS). 
You should allow only encrypted connections over HTTPS (TLS) using the aws:SecureTransport condition on Amazon S3 bucket policies.
The other answers do not guarantee the data will be encrypted during transit.

You have been tasked with investigating and congregating all dropped traffic going to one network interface in your VPC when users try to access 
your EC2 application. What is the most cost effective and least effort solution your can use to gather this information?

Enabling VPC Flow Logs on the ENI attached to the EC2 instance is a quick solution to implement.
All we need to capture is the rejected traffic (rather than all the traffic).
Storing the information on CloudWatch is an easy way to congregate all of the logs together.

You have multiple EC2 instances within a VPC that is located in us-west-2. You have been notified by another team member that
these instances need to have optimal networking performance. These instance are communicating with other instances in other VPCs located
in us-east-1 through VPC peering. Which of the following options are appropriate when ensuring the maximum network performance?

Since the packets are going to leave the AWS region you cannot take advantage of the 9001 MTUs. Once they leave the region the packet will use 1500 MTUs. 
You can however take advantage of Enhanced Networking capabilities on select instance types.

What is the allowed secondary IPv4 CIDR block ranges for an AWS VPC?

The allowed size for a secondary IPv4 CIDR block is between a /28 netmask and /16 netmask

Gateway load balancer - Layer 3 
Accessed as an endpoint service
Not assigned an FQQDN
Inorder to access GWLB, you need to access the endpoints

Once the traffic receives to GWLB, it will behave as layer 4 which means it will transfer the data to target groups
Encapsulated GENEVE protocol
No IPV6 support
Does not encrypt/decrypt
Single listeneer accepts all traffic
All traffic forwarded to a single target group
Protocol is only geneve and port is 6081
Flow stickiness

Only access as a VPC endpoint service
GWLB must be in a different subnet other than consumer VPC.supports applications that process network traffic flows


Cloud front

Regional edge cache is a mid cahce between edge and end user

CF distribution define how cloudfront handles requests for content
Applying changes will take time to reflect in all edge locations sat 15 minutes

Cloud front origin defines where the original content is stored
Origin is defined by FQDN, ELB, S3 BUCKET, Mediastore container, Media package endpoint, Custom FQDN
Add origin as needed
One origin as primary and secondary any numbers
A viewer request is a request made by a client out over the public internet to a CloudFront edge location
By default, all origin requests will connect to the origin within the AWS infrastructure using HTTP.

Origin access identities are used in S3
Recommended to set listener policy to https only
