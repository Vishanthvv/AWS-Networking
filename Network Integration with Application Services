Hosted ZONES in AWS

Public and Private

Public - Request from the public internet (External)
Private - Request from the VPC (Internal). VPCs must have DNS support and DNS hostnames enabled
Private domains do not require to register with ICAAN

CNAME vs Alias
Both resolve DNS queries using other records

CNAME -

DNS Record Type
Refered to as an alias
Redirects to other DNS record names
Returns FQDN to clients
Charge per query
Name cannot be reqused in zone
Not used to represent zone apex

Alias -
Not a DNS record type
AWS route 53 extension
Redirects to AWS service objects
Returns IP address clients
No query charges
Can be used to represent zone apex

You need to give a VPC id for private zone

Routing policies determines how to respond to queries, can be assoaciated with health checks
Simple, weighted, latency based, failover , geolocation & multi value response routing policy


Failover routing policy


Geolocation route policy - The most specific location is always preferred
To lock users to a specfic region, consider not setting a default location

To improve the accuracy of a geolocation routing, use edns-client-subnet extension
