Basically DNS Indepth

aws.amazon.com
Here .com is the top level domain

Generic domain - .org, .com, .cloud, net
Geographic domain - .in, .au, .ae


& Next is amazon - is second level domain
& aws is subdomain


aws.amazon.com. - fqdn

subdomain com is the subdomain of root
amazon is a sub domain of .com
aws is a subdomain of amazon


Name servers - Translates domain name to IP address
Name servers can be authorative and non-authorative

Authorative NS - Provides answers to queries they know about
Non-Authorative NS - Points to other servers or servers cached content from other name servers data

Zones - holds important information in how to route raffic for domain names and its sub domains

Records - A & AAAA - IPV4 & IPV6
CNAME - ALIAS Records
MX - Used to define mail exchange servers
TEXT Records - Holds test information
PTR record is a reverse A record lookup, maps an ipaddress to a host
SOA - Start of authority
CAA - Certificate authority auhtorization
NAPTR - Name authority pointer
SPF - Send policy framework
SRV - Service locator


Hosted ZONES in AWS

Public and Private

Public - Request from the public internet (External)
Private - Request from the VPC (Internal). VPCs must have DNS support and DNS hostnames enabled
Private domains do not require to register with ICAAN

CNAME vs Alias
Both resolve DNS queries using other records

CNAME -

DNS Record Type
Refered to as an alias
Redirects to other DNS record names
Returns FQDN to clients
Charge per query
Name cannot be reqused in zone
Not used to represent zone apex

Alias -
Not a DNS record type
AWS route 53 extension
Redirects to AWS service objects
Returns IP address clients
No query charges
Can be used to represent zone apex

You need to give a VPC id for private zone

Routing policies determines how to respond to queries, can be assoaciated with health checks
Simple, weighted, latency based, failover , geolocation & multi value response routing policy


Failover routing policy


Geolocation route policy - The most specific location is always preferred
To lock users to a specfic region, consider not setting a default location

To improve the accuracy of a geolocation routing, use edns-client-subnet extension

Healthcheck is used for failover
Define target endpoints by IP address or domain name
Protocol used to check are http, https, tcp
Port number
Optional file path for http/https checks

A check fails if there is no response
4 seconds for http/https
10 seconds for tcp

Domainname health checkes only use IPV4

Latency routing uses route 53 record associated with AWS region closest to requesting client
Latency is tested against regional endpoints not the value of route 53 records

Create IP address health checkes for endpoints using latency routing
Route 53 health check prevents clients from being sent to oflline endpoints

DNS faillover requires multiple records or IP addresses for a hostname
Creating healh checks for alias record in un necessary

If health chek is not confgiured, Route 53 will never know the status of the endpoint and the query will be send to the endpoint
So if you give a record A a weight of 10 and other record B a weight of 5, every 15 queries, Record A will server 10 and Record B will server 5
