Design and Implement AWS Networks
Subnet is associated with each AZ
Edge location deliver the contents in milli seconds - The backbone of cloud front
AZ can be made up of single or multiple data centers
Private services are known an VPC capable services. VPC lives within a region
Public services sits outside of the VPC
Subnet cannot span AZ

Default upto 5 VPCs can be created in a region for an account. However you can increase it after opening a ticket with AWS
CIDR - Classless intert domain routing
It is very important to know the number of IP address required before planning a VPC
x.x.x.x/24 = 2 (32 - 24) = 2 *8 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2
which is 256 IP

Here AWS reservers 5 IPS, so used will be 251 IPs
