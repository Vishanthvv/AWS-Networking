Design and Implement AWS Networks
Subnet is associated with each AZ
Edge location deliver the contents in milli seconds - The backbone of cloud front
AZ can be made up of single or multiple data centers
Private services are known an VPC capable services. VPC lives within a region
Public services sits outside of the VPC
Subnet cannot span AZ

Default upto 5 VPCs can be created in a region for an account. However you can increase it after opening a ticket with AWS
CIDR - Classless intert domain routing
It is very important to know the number of IP address required before planning a VPC
x.x.x.x/24 = 2 (32 - 24) = 2 *8 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2
which is 256 IP

Here AWS reservers 5 IPS, so used will be 251 IPs

You can choose a CIDR between /16 and /28 CIDR block

Default VPC CIDR is always is 172.31.x.x/16

Assume that you created a VPC in a region which is having 3 AZ
You have given VPC CIDR as 10.0.0.0/16
You need to divide the above CIDR to three parts and assign to 3 AZs

Smallest CIDR block you can use is /28 and the largest is /16
AWS reserves first four IP address and last IP address for internal use


Avoid using the default VPC, if you are using inter VPC communication

VPC router are highly available and occupies one IP address on every subnet associated with our VPC
It allows communication between subnets in the same VPC. This is what static 'local' route table entry defines.

A logical construct where all routing decisions begin.
This is the first place where packet hits when leaving resources that are in a subnet/VPC
VPC router cannot be seen in the AWS console, VPC router will be present in every subnet
When you create a VPC, it will create a logical component created named as route tables (Main route table)

Recommended to create custom route table per subnet


IGW - They are the interpretor between VPC and public network/ Internet
VGW -  (Virtual private gateway) used as an interface t interconnect the onpremise network or VPN

ENI - Conntected to an instance in an VPC and are associated with a subnet, will be having MAC ID
SG can be attached to ENI
NIC teaming is not supported in AWS and in ENIs

In route table, default route in destination is always the VPC CIDR

Elastic IP - You can have default 5 IPs. These are public IPs
AWS recommends to use elastic IP

Assume that we have two subnets in a single AZ
You can create an ec2 instance and attach two ENI.
One ENI can be associated to Subnet A and the second one can be associated to Subnet B
